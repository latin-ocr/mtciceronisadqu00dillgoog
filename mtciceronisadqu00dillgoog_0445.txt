restraint of Latin rhetoricisns, in these words: “It
has been announeed to us that there are men who
have commeneed a new system of education3 that

they have styled themselves Latin rhetorioians, and '

thst our young men are daily listening to their in-
struo-tion.. Our anoestors have told us what things
they wished their children to leam, and what
sehools they should attend. These innovatione
being adverse to the practices and precepto of our

aneestors seem to us neither pleasing nor profita-
ble; we therefore deem it expedient publicly to
express our disapprohation os them, ss well of their
professors.”
